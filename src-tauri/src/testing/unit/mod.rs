/// Unit Tests for Service Business Logic and Command Layer
/// 
/// This module provides isolated unit tests for service business logic and
/// comprehensive command layer testing using mock repository implementations.
/// These tests focus on functionality without database dependencies, enabling
/// fast and reliable testing.
/// 
/// ## Features
/// - Isolated testing of business logic
/// - Comprehensive command layer coverage
/// - Mock repository dependencies
/// - Error handling verification  
/// - Security validation preservation
/// - Edge case coverage
/// - Performance characteristics testing
