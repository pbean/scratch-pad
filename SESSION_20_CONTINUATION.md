# Session 20 Continuation Prompt

I need you to continue fixing test failures in the Scratch Pad project. This is Session 20 of an ongoing effort to reach >90% test pass rate.

## CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- Branch: claude-session-20250121-test-remediation (8 commits ahead)
- Current: 180/259 tests passing (69.5%)
- Target: 233+ tests (>90%)
- Gap: Need 53 more passing tests
- Last commit: ea0d25b "fix: Session 19 - Fix test suite issues and improve test pass rate"

## SESSION 19 COMPLETED:
- Fixed CommandPalette syntax errors (act() blocks now close)
- Added data-testid attributes for better test targeting
- Fixed TabBar and NoteView element selection
- Tests now run but have async/timing issues

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
The main issue is **improper async/await patterns** causing:
- "Overlapping act() calls" warnings
- Elements not found even though rendered
- Focus management failures

## YOUR MISSION:
Fix async patterns to reach >90% test pass rate by:

1. **Fix async-timeout-utils test** (1 test):
   - Error: "Cannot call timers.runAll() inside callback"
   - Check src/test/__tests__/async-timeout-utils.test.ts

2. **Fix CommandPalette async patterns** (22 potential fixes):
   - Current pattern is broken - state is set but component renders too early
   - Need to use `await act(async () => {})` properly
   - Set state FIRST, THEN render, THEN wait for elements

3. **Apply same fixes to other test files**:
   - SearchHistoryView tests
   - Settings tests
   - Any tests with "overlapping act()" warnings

## START WITH:
```bash
cd /home/paulb/dev/scratch-pad
git checkout claude-session-20250121-test-remediation
cat internal-docs/SESSION_20_PROMPT.md
pnpm test --run 2>&1 | grep "Tests  " | tail -1
pnpm test --run src/test/__tests__/async-timeout-utils.test.ts
```

The detailed plan is in internal-docs/SESSION_20_PROMPT.md. Focus on fixing async patterns - this is the key to unlocking 50+ test fixes.
