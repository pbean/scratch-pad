## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Global Shortcut Not Working

1. **Check for Conflicts**: Another application might be using the same shortcut
2. **Change Shortcut**: Go to Settings and set a different combination
3. **Restart Application**: Sometimes a restart resolves shortcut registration issues
4. **Run as Administrator** (Windows): Some systems require elevated privileges for global shortcuts

#### Application Won't Start

1. **Check System Requirements**: Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements
2. **Update WebView2** (Windows): Download the latest WebView2 runtime from Microsoft
3. **Check Permissions** (macOS): Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy and allow the app
4. **Install Dependencies** (Linux): Ensure GTK3 and WebKit2GTK are installed

#### Notes Not Saving

1. **Check Disk Space**: Ensure you have sufficient disk space
2. **Database Permissions**: The app needs write access to its data directory
3. **Antivirus Software**: Some antivirus programs may interfere with database operations

#### Search Not Working

1. **Database Corruption**: Try restarting the application
2. **Large Note Collections**: Search may be slower with thousands of notes
3. **Special Characters**: Some special characters might affect search results
